Captain William Clark recorded his detailed observations and drew a map that summarizes their journey. Samuel Lewis copied and reduced it so the engraved map could be included in Paul Allen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>History of the Expedition Under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark</em>, published in 1814. The map accurately placed mountain ranges and rivers and has shaped our modern understanding of the topography of the American west.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 100%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 100%"><p><a href="/smith/exhibits/popcart/arrowsmith.html" target="_blank"><img src="/smith/exhibits/popcart/images/aarowsmith_th.jpg" border="0" alt=" " title="Detail from Arrowsmith, Aaron.  &ldquo;A Map Exhibiting All the New Discoveries in the Interior Parts of North America.&rdquo;" hspace="5" width="216" height="143" align="left" /></a>In 1816, Aaron Arrowsmith, an astute British cartographer and publisher, took the geographical information provided by Lewis and Clark and amalgamated their accounts with data from other reports and expeditions to produce this map.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 100%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 100%"><p><a href="/smith/exhibits/popcart/wheeler.html" target="_blank"><img src="/smith/exhibits/popcart/images/wheeler_th.jpg" border="0" alt=" " title="&ldquo;Map of the Territory Crossed by Lewis and Clark in 1804-6, Showing the Conditions of 1903&rdquo;" hspace="5" width="162" height="76" align="left" /></a> </p><p>In 1900, as the centennial of the expedition approached, another clever businessman, Olin D. Wheeler, a Northern Pacific Railroad executive, published one of the first guidebooks to the Pacific Northwest. His book prominently featured the network of the Northern Pacific Railroad, but it also contained detailed maps of Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s expedition in relation to the railroads.

This map describes the route of the expedition in relation to national landmarks, monuments, wildlife refuges, Indian reservations, and interstate highways. Turning Lewis and Clark into tourist guides for America, this map oversimplifies crucial information about the journey; for example, the point of embarkation neatly begins where the lines denoting &ldquo;Preparation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recruitment&rdquo; end, making it appear as if the Corps of Discovery set off from Monticello and smoothly proceeded westward, while ending the exploration at the same point of embarkation.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="width: 100%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p align="right"><span style="font-size: small">-Susan Bazargan (Eastern Illinois University)<br />-Hugo Freund (Union College)<br />-Melinda Kashuba (Independent Scholar)<br />-Wendy St. Jean (Dickinson University)</span><br /></p></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END CONTENT -->
