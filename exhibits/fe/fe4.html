<h2>THE CARIBBEAN AND THE 			 LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SETTLEMENTS</h2>
                
<p>This final section shows the French 			 settlements around the mouth of the Mississippi River, as they developed in the 			 early eighteenth century. The section begins with a plan of the emergent town 			 of Port-au-Prince, to remind us that the French had been in the Caribbean since 			 the middle of the seventeenth century, and that it provided a base for the 			 establishment of the French presence in the lower Mississippi 			 valley.The French settlements here tended to be on a larger scale than 			 in the Illinois Country, and they eventually extended for many miles along the 			 Mississippi River, where indeed the longlot pattern is very conspicuous today, 			 especially from the air. John Law gave an early impetus to the settlement, but 			 after the collapse of his schemes the colonists survived, and succeeded in 			 establishing at New Orleans a city of considerable beauty.The 			 French-speaking inhabitants of the lower Mississippi valley eventually built up 			 a culture strong enough to resist Anglicization at the time of the U.S. 			 takeover, with the result that French ways have survived there long after they 			 have almost disappeared from the Illinois Country.</p>

/></a>It was during the first decade of the seventeenth century that
the French began their northern drive into the New World, down the
Saint Lawrence valley. About two decades later, they began
establishing themselves in the West Indies, at first on Saint Kitts
and then on Hispaniola and on such islands of the Lesser Antilles as
Martinique and Guadeloupe. The French colony on Hispaniola was
exceptionally lawless, even for the seventeenth-century Caribbean, but
the buccaneers who composed it gradually transformed themselves into
planters, so that by the end of the century there were substantial
estates producing indigo and cocoa. By the treaty of Ryswick (1697)
the island was divided into French and Spanish sections (named
respectively Saint-Domingue and Santo Domingo), and the French Crown
played an increasingly important role there. It seems to have been
after the visit of Champsmeslin in 1723 that Port-au-Prince was chosen
as the site for a capital, a choice ratified and implemented in
1738. Our plan shows the future site of the capital about 1710, and
has many notes about where the anchorages and their protecting forts
might be. Already, too, there are two <i>habitations</i>, belonging to
the sieur Fortin (top) and to the sieur Morel (bottom). The fields lie
away to the right, out of the plan, but we can see that each
plantation had its slave-quarters (tightly grouped small houses) and
also its gardens (enclosed areas). During the eighteenth century
Saint-Domingue would greatly flourish in economic terms, at
incalculable human cost, and would often serve as the base for French
penetration of the lower Mississippi River valley. </p>
        
            <h3>Anonymous manuscript map of the lower 			 Mississippi River, c. 1723. Cartes Marines, The Newberry Library. </h3>
        
        
            <p><a href="38c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/38th.jpg" alt="" /></a>This remarkable map, which does not seem to have any 			 close counterpart in the French archives, shows the lower Mississippi River 			 during the first decade of French settlement there. The town of New Orleans, 			 founded about five years earlier, lies on the very distinctive bend in the 			 river (whose course is perfectly recognizable in comparison with modern maps), 			 and each side of it are the new holdings, set out in the longlot style. 			 Upon each holding we can see what looks like a careful delineation of 			 the buildings, as well as the name of the landowner. Each of these could be 			 analyzed, to build up a picture of the colony's structure at this moment. Down 			 in the bottom left, for instance, are two lots marked "habitation des 			 Allemands;" these must have been among the 300 Alsatians brought to Louisiana 			 through John Law's arrangements in 1722. In between these two lots is one 			 marked "Habitation a Monsieur Arensbourg;" he was a Swedish captain and their 			 leader. Working downriver, we come to a holding extending right across 			 the Mississippi River, and belonging to the "Sieur Sainton;" he was the son of 			 a lawyer from Châtellerault, and was trying to establish himself here. 			 Next to him is a squarish plot called the "Terrain au sieur Manadé." 			 Pierre de Manadé was a surgeon who was adapting well to the new life; he 			 raised cattle - perhaps on this very <i>terrain</i> - and had taken an Indian 			 as his wife. This early French establishment has marked the area down to the 			 present day, for satellite images of the Lower Mississippi sharply reveal the 			 continuing pattern of the longlots. </p>

            <h3>Anonymous manuscript plan of Fort 			 Condé at Mobile, c. 1720. Cartes Marines, The Newberry Library. 			 </h3>
        
        
            <p><a href="40c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/40th.jpg" alt="" /></a>The French had established themselves at 			 Mobile in 1702, but had moved their settlement in 1710, coming to the site of 			 the modern city. This plan shows the situation in about 1720, thus falling 			 between plans of 1711, 1725 and 1731 preserved at the Archives Nationales in 			 Paris. Fort Condé (formerly Fort Louis) lies in the center of a great 			 fortified work, and the settlers' houses stretch away on each side of the fort, 			 alongside the marshes bordering the Mobile River. Inside the fort are 			 the barracks at "A," and the storehouse at "B;" the barracks are not quite 			 finished, and neither is the great ditch which will one day surround the fort. 			 In the town, the houses are shown as simple blocks, each in an area of garden, 			 without any key to tell us who lived where. There is, however, an interesting 			 elevation at the top of the plan, showing how the houses in the fort looked 			 from the point "E" on the plan. This elevation does not correspond very 			 satisfactorily with the plan, but it seems to be showing us a line of rather 			 elegant two-story houses, with frequent doors and windows on the ground floor, 			 mansard roofs and dormer windows.Between 1711 and 1720 Mobile was the 			 capital of French Louisiana, but after that time it was eclipsed by New 			 Orleans, ideally situated to take advantage of the growing trade on the 			 Mississippi River. Mobile continued to prosper as the center of the Indian 			 trade down to the time of the Treaty of Paris in 1763.</p>

            <h3>Jean François Benjamin Dumont de 			 Montigny, "Logement de l'autheur à la Nouvelle Orléans," 1747. 			 The Newberry Library. </h3>
        
            <p><a href="41c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/41th.jpg" alt="" /></a>Dumont de Montigny came to Louisiana in 			 1719, and was employed as an engineer at Natchez and at New Orleans. He 			 returned to France in 1738, and there published his <i>Mémoires 			 Historiques sur la Louisiane</i> (2 vols., Paris 1753); these little volumes 			 contain much information about the Indians of the area, and have plans of both 			 Natchez and New Orleans. The Newberry possesses the original manuscript memoir 			 out of which the <i>Mémoires</i> were apparently composed, and this 			 contains the little plan shown here. This plan delineates the "logement de 			 l'autheur a la Nouvelle Orléans," and probably shows a fairly typical 			 French establishment at New Orleans of the 1730s. At the bottom of the image is 			 a flight of steps, which probably led down to the river, for, as we shall see, 			 most French holdings had a frontage on the Mississippi River. These steps lead 			 into a palisaded enclosure, in which is the main house ("1"), the kitchen and 			 Negro quarters ("2" and "11"), and a "pavilion" ("3"). Behind the main house is 			 a curious feature: the "ladder up which the poultry go to sleep in the tree" 			 ("10"). Passing through the other gap in the palisade, we come to a 			 small garden with a trellis ("5"), flowerbeds and two ponds ("7" and "8"). This 			 in turn leads into the main garden ("9"), which seems to have a variety of 			 orchards and vegetable-beds. We have to remember that at this time the French 			 had only been settled in this area for a couple of decades, and settlers like 			 Montigny were perhaps experimenting with different kinds of trees and plants, 			 to see what would grow best in the hot and humid delta. </p>

            <h3>Anonymous manuscript plan of New 			 Orleans, 1723. Cartes Marines, The Newberry Library.</h3>

            <p><a href="43c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/43th.jpg" alt="" /></a>Work on the site of New Orleans began in 1718, but 			 did not become serious until 1722, when the fledgling town became the capital 			 of French Louisiana. Our plan, which is one in a numerous series of plans 			 preserved in Paris at the Archives Nationales and the Bibliothèque 			 Nationale, shows the town at the end of 1722. As the legend at the top says, we 			 have here an account of the present state of houses built, and in yellow an 			 outline of what remains to be done to the fortifications. The key takes 			 us around the public buildings, many of which still stand in much the same 			 position in modern New Orleans. The main buildings are grouped round the "place 			 d'armes," with the directors' houses facing the river (here still called the 			 "Fleuve St. Louis"). The main storehouse is at "H," and is not quite finished; 			 the hospital and arsenal are away to the east, by the river. The barracks for 			 the Swiss, German and French workers ("M," "N," and "O") are on an internal 			 street, now Royal Street. The successive town-plans for New Orleans, 			 which continued to grow throughout the eighteenth century, allow us to see 			 precisely how its expansion took place. In the central area, the present 			 street-pattern conforms exactly to the layout of the early eighteenth century, 			 while in the suburbs the streets follow the lines dictated by the 			 estate-boundaries of the longlot system. </p>

            <h3>Jean François Benjamin Dumont de 			 Montigny, "Carte de Fort Rosalie des Natchez," 1747. The Newberry Library. 			 </h3>
        
<p><a href="44c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/44th.jpg" alt="" /></a>The French judged in the early eighteenth century 			 that they needed a fort in the vicinity of the Natchez Indians, about two 			 hundred miles north of New Orleans, and so in 1716 they built Fort Rosalie 			 there. Named after the wife of the Comte de Pontchartrain, <i>Ministre de la 			 Marine</i> between 1699 and 1715, this was a fairly crude little palisaded 			 fort, around which a French settlement soon developed. There were eventually 			 more than one thousand farmers growing tobacco, wheat and other crops, but they 			 were almost all forced to flee after a great uprising by the Natchez Indians in 			 1729. Dumont de Montigny's little sketch shows the area just before 			 this event. Fort Rosalie is in the center, on its bluff above the Mississippi 			 River ("Fleuve St. Louis"), and then in the background, among the rolling 			 countryside, are the various farms. Dumont shows considerable cultivated areas 			 around them, as well as a "village sauvage;" this was apparently the Natchez 			 Indian center, the "grand village" now preserved as a mound site in Natchez. 			 This village has at its center a circular palisade; most of the French famrs 			 are simply set in the open country, though a group of buildings at the top 			 right is enclosed by a square palisade. It may be that Europeans tended to 			 build square palisades, and Indian peoples to construct round ones. In general, 			 the open and dispersed nature of the French farms around Natchez must have made 			 them particularly vulnerable to attacks like the one of 1729. </p>
