<h2>THE GREAT LAKES AND THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY</h2>
        
        
<p>With the maps of this region we can examine the stages of
settlement, from early posts like Fort Frontenac and Michilimackinac
down to the settled agricultural societies in the areas round Detroit,
Winnipeg, Dubuque, Vincennes and Illinois Country.For a long time
there were no substantial towns in this area, so our maps are weak on
urban development. But they are very strong on rural patterns of
landholding, with many examples of the spread of the longlot
system. Some of the most telling images come from the time of the
U.S. General Land Office survey, when the rectangular system butted up
against the by-then ancient longlots. On the whole, the surveyors
obeyed their instructions to observe existing patterns of landholding,
which is why in many places the longlots survive to the present day,
mute testimony to the early presence of the habitants.</p>
        
<h3>Anonymous manuscript plan of Fort 			 Frontenac, c. 1720. Cartes Marines, The Newberry Library.</h3>
        
<p><a href="20c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/20th.jpg" alt="" /></a>This plan, which may well be the work of Chaussegros 			 de Léry or his workshop, shows Fort Frontenac in 1673 on the north shore 			 of Lake Ontario, where Kingston now stands, at a place known to the Indians as 			 "Cataracouy." This was obviously a strategic site, controlling access to the 			 Great Lakes from the Saint Lawrence River valley. There are numerous 			 plans of the fort, dating from 1685 onwards; several are preserved at the 			 Archives Nationales in Paris. The early ones do not show any Indian presence, 			 but by the time of our plan the "cabannes des sauvages" are numerous; one 			 longhouse is interestingly shown in elevation. The gardens are also extensive, 			 and the other features outside the walls of the fort are a barn and stables 			 (top left) and limekiln (top right). The latter is interestingly drawn, no 			 doubt representing a circular stone kiln, probably lined with brick, and a ramp 			 up which wood and lime could be wheeled in order to feed the 			 furnace.Some of the lime was probably used on the fields, and some went 			 into cement for the building of the fort. This was constructed in the classic 			 European style, with four corner bastions named after saints, and a single 			 entrance over a moat, surveyed by the guard-house. The fort was well equipped, 			 with a powder magazine (lower left), a bakery, a well, a smithy, a circular 			 food-store and a hospital. Along the northern wall were the chapel and the 			 lodgings for the garrison, sheltered from the wind and open to as much sun as 			 possible.</p>

            <h3>Anonymous manuscript plans of 			 Michilimackinac, Fort de Chambly and Fort Frontenac, c. 1717. Cartes Marines, 			 The Newberry Library.</h3>
        
            <p><a href="21c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/21th.jpg" alt="" /></a>The two lower plans (not reproduced in this exhibit, 			 which shows only the upper plan, of Michilimackinac) show places that we have 			 already described. On the left is Fort de Chambly, shown here in relation to 			 its village and mill. On the right is Fort de Frontenac, looking southwards; 			 the Saint Lawrence River comes in from the left, and Lake Ontario is on the 			 right. It is a pity that this sketch is so summary, for it would have been a 			 good chance to show us more of the environs of Fort Frontenac.The upper 			 plan, for which no counterpart seems to exist elsewhere, shows Michilimackinac, 			 on the strategic juncture between Lakes Huron (right) and Michigan (left, "Lac 			 des Illinois"). The main settlement is on the north shore, around the "Maison 			 des Jesuites." To the north of it are shown two Indian villages, and to the 			 south is "Missilimakinac," with more houses around a small palisaded fort. The 			 legend tells us that among the inhabitants were already some French women, and 			 that during the trading season in 1716 there were about 600 French <i>coureurs 			 de bois</i> there. To the south of the main town were the "champs des 			 sauvages," where presumably some corn was grown. To the east, in the bay, the 			 "peche du poisson blanc" is shown; the white fish were very abundant at this 			 time, and could no doubt help the community to survive the very harsh winters. 			 On the southern peninsula are also shown some houses around a small palisaded 			 fort; this would eventually be the site of the large French fort captured by 			 the English, and now transformed into a major historical site. </p>

            <h3>Jacques-Nicolas Bellin, <i>Carte des 			 Cinq Grands Lacs du Canada</i> (Paris, 1764). The Newberry Library.</h3>
        
            <p><a href="23c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/23th.jpg" alt="" /></a>In 1764, Bellin published his <i>Le Petit Atlas 			 Maritime</i> in five volumes at Paris. The first volume dealt with North 			 America and the West Indies, and contained 102 maps. It covered the whole area, 			 using maps drawn from the work of the different European cartographers, and was 			 a demonstration of the remarkable prowess of both French mapmaking and Parisian 			 printing. The map shown here comes from volume I and was "number 6." It 			 shows roughly the same area as the previous manuscript map, but introduces some 			 changes, mostly in the direction of a truer delineation of coastlines. Fort 			 Frontenac ("Fort de Cataracouy") is this time prominent, as is the town of 			 Detroit. Lake Superior has an improved outline, though it still contains far 			 too many islands and its shape is much inferior to that of the early Jesuit map 			 (number 8). Following the manuscript, the printed version has a non-existent 			 line of mountains running down the center of what will be the state of 			 Michigan; we are also offered the alternative of "Fleuve St Louis" for the 			 Mississippi River. At least two lead mines ("mines de plomb") are shown 			 on the Upper Mississippi, where the French would soon begin mining operations 			 on a large scale. Like the manuscript, the printed version offers a scrupulous 			 set of latitudes and longitudes on its margins. In spite of the occasional 			 corrections offered on the printed version, its outlines are in general coarser 			 and less detailed than those of the manuscript; this was perhaps the inevitable 			 result of the transition from handwriting to copper-engraving. </p>

            <h3>Detail from Orange Risdon, <i>Map of the 			 Surveyed Part of the Territory of Michigan</i> (Albany, 1825). The Newberry 			 Library. </h3>
        
            <p><a href="24c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/24th.jpg" alt="" /></a>This map dates from the early period of U.S. westward 			 expansion, when the township-and-range system was being established throughout 			 the Midwest. However, it is of interest to us because it shows with great 			 fidelity the former pattern of French landholding around Detroit. The city had 			 been founded in 1701, and for several decades was primarily a mission and 			 trading-post, to which furs came from a wide area. In the 1740s the fur-trade 			 began to be siphoned off by English settlers from Pennsylvania, and the French 			 Crown resolved to strengthen Detroit as a barrier against westward English 			 expansion, establishing it as an agricultural settlement. Settlers were 			 induced to come to the Detroit region by various concessions, so that numbers 			 increased considerably between 1749 and 1755. However, they remained quite low 			 in absolute terms, so that by 1760, when the fall of French Canada occurred, 			 there were still only about 2,500 <i>habitants </i>and <i>métis</i>. By 			 the end of the eighteenth century these settlers were to be found in three main 			 groups, shown on our map. The largest was around the town of Detroit itself, 			 where we see the words "Old French locations." Just to the south, and running 			 into the Detroit settlement, were the longlots of the French along the River 			 Rouge. Our map shows detail only for U.S. territory, but there were 			 corresponding French holdings on the eastern bank of the Detroit River, where 			 the town of "Sandwich" is shown. The third group was along the River 			 Raisin, 30 miles to the south, with French Town near its mouth (opposite 			 Monroe). The "Old French locations" posed a problem to the surveyors of the 			 township-and-range system, into whose neat quadrilaterals the longlots to 			 incongruously cut. But the surveyors were instructed to respect these existing 			 property rights, which is what now allows us precisely to locate areas of 			 French settlement. </p>

            <h3>Aaron Greeley, Detail from the <i>Plan 			 of Private Claims in the Michigan Territory </i>(1810). The Newberry 			 Library.</h3>
        
            <p><a href="25c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/25th.jpg" alt="" /></a>This is the middle section from a three-section map 			 setting out French holdings in the Michigan territory about 1810. It shows in 			 close detail the area first described on the previous map, around Detroit. The 			 city itself is marked down by the river, and has the star-shaped street pattern 			 that the early citizens hoped would give their city a plan like that of 			 L'Enfant's Washington; today that pattern survives only in fragments. 			 Opposite Detroit is the gridiron of the town of Sandwich. This had 			 grown up on the site of the Huron village marked on Montresor's map of 1763; on 			 Greeley's map only one "Indian village" is shown, to the north-west of Detroit. 			 Each plot receives a number, keyed to the list of mostly francophone 			 landholders, among whom there was not a great variation in size of holding. 			 There is a large rectangular holding of 10,000 acres granted to the Michigan 			 Territory by the Federal Government to defray the cost of public buildings; 			 this was a device often used by the central government to aid the fledgling 			 states without having to pay out federal tax money. At this stage the 			 French names are still quite intact and correct. Detroit, of course, is hard to 			 anglicize, but most of the river-names have more or less their correct French 			 forms. The exception is "Prisq Isle," down towards what is now Grosse Pointe. 			 As time went by, there was a tendency for French names to become more and more 			 mangled throughout the Midwest. </p>

<h3>Thomas Hutchins, <i>A Plan of the 			 Several Villages in the Illinois Country</i> (London, 1778). The Newberry 			 Library. </h3>
        
            <p><a href="31c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/31th.jpg" alt="" /></a>Thomas Hutchins (1730-1789) was a lieutenant in the 			 (British) 60th Regiment of Foot, who served in North America and made numerous 			 maps, many of which were published; he eventually became Geographer to the 			 United States. He derived the map shown here directly from a French manuscript, 			 now preserved in Paris. It is a remarkably elegant little map, which plainly 			 sets out the situation of the French settlements in the Illinois Country about 			 1770. At the top is Saint Louis, which had received an influx of French 			 people since the English conquest of Canada in 1760. Then there is a string of 			 villages on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, below the bluff line, 			 indicated by hachures; this was fertile bottom-land, much used by the Indians. 			 From the top we have Cahokia, first settled at the beginning of the eighteenth 			 century. Then, after "Belle Fountain" and "St. Phillips" we come to what 			 Hutchins calls "Fort Charters," the French Fort de Chartres. This lies close by 			 Prairie du Rocher; the settlement was closed off to the south by the village of 			 Kaskaskia. By the middle of the eighteenth century about 1500 people - 			 500 of whom were slaves - lived in these villages. They produced a formidable 			 quantity of cereals and other crops, much of which was exported downstream to 			 the new focus of French power around New Orleans. Indeed, the Illinois Country, 			 which had been largely peopled from Canada, looked more and more towards New 			 Orleans as time went by, and the Mississippi valley came to be a sort of French 			 preserve. </p>

            <h3>"A Plan of Cascaskies," from Captain 			 Philip Pittman, <i>The Present State of the European Settlements on the 			 Mississippi</i> (London, 1770). The Newberry Library.</h3>
        
            <p><a href="35c.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/35th.jpg" alt="" /></a>The little town at Kaskaskia was the most southerly 			 among the settlements in the Illinois Country. As the plan shows, it lay on the 			 west bank of the River Kaskaskia, with the Mississippi River to the west again 			 of it. This plan was drawn in 1776 by the English officer Captain Philip 			 Pittman, and accompanied his report. At that time Kaskaskia had about 			 65 French families, numbering about 350 people, together with over 300 slaves. 			 Its site on the River Kaskaskia was advantageous, for it allowed boats coming 			 out of the Mississippi River to escape that turbulent stream, and pull up to 			 the bank in quiet water; the River Kaskaskia also had sites for water-mills 			 ("Road to Madame Paget's Mill"), essential for grinding the wheat produced in 			 the fertile bottom-lands. The town had not been laid out formally, like 			 many other French towns in the New World, but had just grown at the whim of the 			 inhabitants, who did not feel the need to fortify themselves against the 			 neighboring Indians. The church ("D") was the most substantial structure, and 			 had been built by the Jesuits, who had been expelled in 1763. By the time of 			 this plan, their lands were in the hands of "Monsieur Beauvais," who had 86 			 slaves and had furnished "Eighty-six thousand weight of flour" to the king's 			 magazine. Kaskaskia continued to thrive into the nineteenth century, but in 			 1881 was largely destroyed when the Mississippi River changed its course and 			 swallowed up the town. </p>
