<h5>The Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography</h5>
<h3>Maps and Nations Exhibit, 1998</h3>
<p>One major part of the 1998 Maps and Nations seminar the participants 		particularly enjoyed was the planning and development of a public exhibition 		that would follow the themes of the seminar. To begin the process, each of the 		participants chose an item from the Newberry's collections and drafted a 		commentary on its relation to cartographic nationalism. They then critiqued 		each other's work, and used these items as a springboard to talk about exhibit 		theme and structure. You may also wish to view the Maps and Nations Exhibit, 		1999 (<i>forthcoming, mid-September 2005</i>).</p>

Scholars disagree about the identity of the 				author and illustrator: Florentine Dominican Leonardo Dati (1360-1425) or his 				brother, a businessman, Gregorio (Goro) Datis (1363-1436). Throughout the work, 				there are astronomical, meteorological, and geographical images of the world 				and careful representations of the Mediterranean coastline integrated into the 				text.</p>
            <p>In this map, Jerusalem is located centrally, and appears as a 				stylized, walled city dominated by a cross, and presiding over a barren 				landscape. The map renders Jerusalem recognizable to Europeans, and claims it 				as a Christian center. Whether or not this map is derivative or an example of 				period portolan charts (coastal navigation plans), the detailed depiction of 				the coastline with its measured distances between towns is further indicative 				of the European political, religious, and economic interest in what we now term 				the Middle East, beginning during the Crusades and continuing even today.</p>

Frederic de Wit&rsquo;s Atlas, typical of most Dutch atlases, reflects the 				ambiguities of popular Western European views of Eastern Europe during this 				time.</p>
            <p> The kingdom of Hungary was always represented spatially as part 				of the continent of Europe. However, the cultural depictions of Hungary 				differed markedly, and inconsistently so, from that of the Western European 				powers. While the cartouches of England and Holland depict scenes of cherubic 				mirth, the menacing cartouche seen here symbolizes Hungary as a place of 				conflict and violence. While instruments of cartographic measurement adorn maps 				of western political regions, Pan guards the scale bar of Hungary, an 				indication of uncertainty and ambiguity. The inconsistent spatial placement and 				cultural connotations of images of Eastern Europe in seventeenth century 				atlases suggest an unsolidified view of this world region among Western 				Europeans.</p>

Although 				possibly influenced by Europeans, it is within a tradition of indigenous 				documentation and representation. Heiroglyphs present the essential elements of 				a story which would also have been narrated orally.</p>
            <p>The migratory story of the Aztecs starts in their island home of 				Aztlan (green hill in the square), and proceeds to Tenochtitlan (the nopal 				cactus at the crossed canals). The initial part of the narrative presents space 				sequentially. A footprinted path indicates movement through time and space from 				site to site. Entering the Valley of Mexico near Chapultepec (the Hill of the 				Grasshopper), however, the story takes a dramatic turn. To emphasize the 				importance of this moment, the map&rsquo;s orientation shifts and readers must 				turn the painting upside down, or move themselves to continue. The map now 				shows a great attention to detail concerning relations between Aztecs and other 				groups, particularly bloody deaths of named individuals and further retreat 				into the marshy lake. Topographical elements are also depicted with greater 				precision, tying events to specific places and landscape. Geographic space is 				now presented, with various towns located on the map as they are located in 				relation to one another on the ground. The history ends at the moment the 				Aztecs founded Tenochtitlan&mdash;the city that will become the center of their 				empire and their world.</p>

Specifically, the 				symbol reflected the Dutch struggle for freedom from Spain and the Habsburg 				Empire. Ultimately developed in four versions, cartographers included various 				provinces, identifying them as <i>Leo Belgicus</i> and <i>Leo 				Hollandius</i>.</p>
            <p>In 1632 Famiano Strada, a pro-Spanish Jesuit, incorporated the 				lion map into a two-volume history on the Netherlandish War of Independence. 				This particular 1648 edition (one of eight) was probably copper engraved in the 				Netherlands. It reveals the strength of the provinces and its role as a 				formidable enemy for the Spanish crown. Originally found in medieval heraldic 				form throughout Europe, the lion rampant personifies the Dutch Republic&rsquo;s 				strength of character, evident in the lion&rsquo;s bared teeth and its raised 				right foreleg. With tail erect and encircling a compass rose, the figure 				reflects the pride of the Dutch and their ability as a maritime power.</p>

            <p>This elaborately decorated edition, probably engraved by Johannes 				Doetecum, was not only a practical navigational tool, but also expressed the 				Dutch East India Company&rsquo;s commercial prowess in the region. Geographical 				information is concentrated in the port areas, giving little or no indication 				of interior colonization. Both text and decorative elements described the 				abundance of natural resources that were available for European consumption. 				Added images of nutmeg and sandalwood reinforced the Dutch penchant for 				describing, while the prominent Dutch <i>fluijts</i> (ships) laid claim to the 				surrounding seas.</p>

On closer examination, however, it is more remarkable for the ways 				in which it combines scientific mapmaking, Spanish nationalism, and Catholic 				piety. The queen, who resembles the Virgin Mary, gazes toward a Star of 				Bethlehem in the upper left, and the Sacred Heart of Catholic iconography has 				become a compass rose. Above her crown, Rome is represented as the Holy 				Spirit&mdash;a clear assertion of Church supremacy during a period of escalating 				conflict between the Jesuit Order and the Spanish Crown.</p>

            <p>Early in the Cold War, State Department officials likened 				communism to an infectious disease. With this map, R.M. Chapin supplies readers 				of Time magazine with a visual representation of the contagion metaphor. The 				map portrays Soviet Russia as a virulent red expanse that infects neighboring 				states with communist dogma. Chapin divides Russia&rsquo;s neighbors into three 				categories depending upon the severity of their infection. 				&ldquo;Quarantined&rdquo; states have completely fallen to communism and are 				therefore inaccessible to democracy and capitalism. &ldquo;Infected&rdquo; states 				contain substantial communist minorities that allow Moscow to influence public 				policy. &ldquo;Exposed&rdquo; states have extensive social problems, which 				provide openings for future infection.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the map is its unusual 				split-spherical presentation of Europe and Asia. With the resulting break in 				the center of the map, Soviet influence seems disturbingly large. Such images 				undoubtedly bolstered public support for the &ldquo;containment&rdquo; of this 				apparently aggressive disease.</p>

While the French had created similar games in the 				seventeenth century, late eighteenth-century England witnessed an explosion in 				the popularity of such map-games. Wallis&rsquo;s firm, which existed from the 				early 1780s until 1847, was a leader in the production of such educational 				games.</p>
            <p>Using game pieces, children followed a route around England, while 				reading descriptions of towns which emphasized the growth of manufacturing and 				transportation networks, as well as historical figures and events. 				Wallis&rsquo;s game familiarized English children with their nation&rsquo;s 				geography as well as stressing its early industrial growth.</p>

            <p>This map, by telling part of the little-known history of Finnish 				colonists in the New World, attempts to create a place for Finns in American 				history. The prominent cluster of pennants at the map&rsquo;s center establishes 				a sense of Finnish presence in America by marking Finnish farmsteads and naming 				their owners. All around the pennants, other pictorial elements (some 				bilingual) attempt to connect the Finnish colonists with United States history. 				For instance, the map claims that William Penn made his famous friendship 				pledge with the Native Americans of Pennsylvania at a Finnish farm. Published 				at a time when Finnish-Americans struggled to define themselves as Americans, 				the map provides powerful assistance, asserting the Finn&rsquo;s long-standing 				ties to the land and peoples that, a century after the activities and events 				shown on the map, became important parts of the United States.</p>

The prominent British abolitionist Thomas 				Clarkson (1760-1846) borrowed cartographic imagery to answer this question, 				offering readers a history of the antislavery movement in a single view. 				Published to celebrate the legal end of the British and United States external 				slave trades in 1807, Clarkson&rsquo;s diagram represents abolitionism as an 				international movement of writers and groups, a &ldquo;swelling torrent&rdquo; of 				interconnected rivers whose currents could be mapped but not reversed. 				Clarkson&rsquo;s emphasis on the philosophical critique of slavery by male 				writers (including himself &ndash; see lower right) and the role of white 				humanitarianism provided the foundation for an interpretation of the end of the 				British slave trade that remained dominant for a century and a half. With the 				aid of recent scholarship, however, we can begin to appreciate how and why 				Clarkson&rsquo;s graphic strategy suppressed conflicts among white abolitionists 				and placed the writings of free blacks and the struggles of slaves themselves 				literally off the map.</p>

This map, 				part of a British administrative atlas of colonial India, displays the progress 				of British railroads, along with roads and other infastructure for 				transportation and communication. Railroad companies bid to construct railroads 				for the British at a guaranteed profit, and built railway gauges according to 				their own convenience. Red lines on the map demarcate the proposed standard 				gauge-width of 5.5 feet, while green lines reflect gauge-widths of smaller 				proportions, as small as 2 feet, creating technical problems in shipping both 				people and freight. The acknowledgement of these variations reflects the 				expression of individual interests within the project of Empire. The map 				displays considerable detail of lands bordering India, suggesting how 				communications networks were linked with adjacent regions, and implying 				possible future land acquisition.</p>

            <p>This map was produced by Anglo Richard Van Falkenburgh for his 				book <i>Navajo Sacred Places</i> and included as part of a 1960s court case to 				help settle the outstanding land claims of the Navajo tribe against the United 				States Government under the Indian Claims Commission.

            <p>In the 1990s, prompted by a different set of concerns, the Navajo 				Office of Historic Preservation produced a different book, also called 				<i>Navajo Sacred Places</i>. This book included no detailed maps because 				revealing the locations might endanger the sites and because the authors 				thought that locating the places on the map removed them from their cultural 				context. Instead, the book included large excerpts from Navajo oral histories 				and origin stories that located places spatially but were impenetrable to 				outsiders.</p>
